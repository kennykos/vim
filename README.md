# vim
Personal vim configuration. Inspired by this [vim/latex setup guide](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/vandyke/notes/getting_started_latex_vim/getting_started.pdf)

## Setup
After cloning this repository (with recursive submodules), move the file to ~/.vim/ (i.e. `mv . ~/.vim).
Please make sure vim is compiled with `+python3`. This can be checked with `:version`.
